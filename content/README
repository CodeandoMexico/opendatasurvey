This folder contains markdown files for the website. 
WHY WE USE THIS?
- Because editing in the spreadsheet is a pain, and writing HTML code on GDocs is a pain as well.

- HOW THIS WILL WORK?
Easy - the files in this folders are already in markdown format. Edit all content here before copying and pasting it to the spreadsheet. Notice, do not copy text to the spreadsheet from the Google Drive, the files there are not in the right format!

You can find the file in their non markdown form on the Google Drive:
