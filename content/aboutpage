# The Global Open Data Index 2016/2017 - Advancing  the State of Open Data Through Dialogue

The Global Open Data Index (GODI) is the annual global benchmark for publication of open government data, run by the Open Knowledge Network. Our crowdsourced survey measures the openness of government data according to the [Open Definition](http://opendefinition.org). 

By having a tool that is run by civil society, GODI creates valuable insights for government’s data publishers to understand where they have data gaps. It also shows how to make data more useable and eventually more impactful. GODI therefore provides important feedback that governments are usually lacking.

For the last 5 years we have been revising GODI methodology to fit the changing needs of the open data movement. This year, we changed our entire survey design by adding experimental questions to assess data findability and usability. We also improved our datasets definitions by looking at essential data points that can solve real world problems. Using more precise data definitions also increased the reliability of our cross-country comparison. See all about the [GODI methodology here](http://index.okfn.org/methodology/)

In addition, this year shall be more than a mere measurement tool. We see it as a tool for conversation. To spark debate, we release GODI in two phases:

1. **The dialogue phase** - We are releasing the data to the public after a rigorous review. Yet, during our assessment some information might have remained unnoticed. We give all users a chance to contest the index results for **30 days, starting May 2nd**. In this period, users of the index can comment on our assessments through our Global Open Data Index forum. On June 2nd, we will review those comments and will change some index submissions if needed.

2. **The final results** - on June 15 we will present the final results of the index. For the first time ever, we will also publish the GODI white paper. This paper will include our main findings and recommendations to advance open data publication.

We hope that by having this new dialogue stage we can have a constructive discussion. This will allow governments and other open data stakeholders to get into dialogue.

Have a question about the process? See our [FAQ page](add link) or post a question on the [GODI forum](https://discuss.okfn.org/c/open-data-index/global-open-data-index-2016).
